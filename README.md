# website-boilerplate

## requirements :

- recent version of ``nodeJs`` and ``npm``

- willingness to use ``Sergey`` - a minimalist static site generator. [Sergey the little SSG.](https://sergey.cool/)

### How to get this website running : 

    1- clone code to your computer : ``git clone {repo url}``

    2- install dependancies via command-line : ``npm install``

    3- build website via command-line : ``npm run start``. Look: there is now a ``Public`` directory which contains all the files your website needs to be deployed

    4- use local web server to speed your development via command-line : ``npm run dev``.  And go to this addresss on your favorite web browser -> [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

    5- that's it : now you're on your own!
