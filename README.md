# website-boilerplate

Build a basic static website with partial views capability (i.e. 'includes') in no time.

## requirements :

- recent version of ``nodeJs`` and ``npm``

- willingness to use ``Sergey`` - a minimalist static site generator. [Sergey the little SSG.](https://sergey.cool/)

### How to get this website running : 

1. clone code to your computer : ``git clone {repo url}``

2. install dependancies via command-line : ``npm install``

3. build website via command-line : ``npm run start``. Look: there is now a ``Public`` directory which contains all the files your website needs to be deployed

4. use local web server to speed your development via command-line : ``npm run dev``.  And go to this addresss on your favorite web browser -> [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

5. that's it : now you're on your own! :zany_face:

### use cases

- You want to put out a website in a very short amount of time

- You want to try out different front-end components, or different configurations
  - you want to try out different calendar components and play with their configs in a smaller scale website than your current real-life project.
